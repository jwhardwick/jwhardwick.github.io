### A lucky find

I recently stumbled upon a trove of tennis match statistics, and being a lover of the game I knew that I had to analyse it. The last 15 years have been a golden age of tennis, where a handful of players have shown unprecedented dominance. Given the dataset covered every ATP match over this period, I knew there would be some interesting trends to uncover.

It was quite overwhelming trying to decide where to get started, as there was data for around ~40 different fields. I knew that I wanted to explore the impact of Big 4, so I chose to look at how the game has changed since the year 2000, focusing on age, rank points, and aces. I also wanted to delve a bit deeper into the data and compare the 4 grand slams.

If you're interested in having a look at the data yourself, it's available [here](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). Credit to [JeffSackman](github.com/JeffSackmann) for doing a great job compiling the statistics.


### Is tennis getting older?

In case you're unfamiliar with the term 'the Big Four', it refers to Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray, and their complete dominance in rankings and tournament victories since 2004. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(tennis)) has a very extensive article on the subject if you want to dive deeper.

Despite their seemingly inhumane achievements, they are still bound by the laws of nature, specifically that their age increases linearly with time. To see this manifested in the data, I plotted the overall winners average age for every Masters and Grand Slam level tournament since 2000.

Unsurprisingly, we see a clear trend of age increasing. One would assume that this trend won't continue for much longer, although as there are no clear successors (except Nick Kyrgios), who knows what will happen. Considering that this years Australian and French Open were won by Federer (age 35), and Nadal (age 31) just took the French, they all seem to showing no signs of slowing down.

### Returning to returns

I've often heard that the importance of serving big has been on the decline in recent years, with a bigger emphasis being placed on return of serve. This shift towards defence is a common trend amongst the top players. Although big servers like Raonic, Isner and Karlovic have had success, they haven't been able to crack top echelons of the tour, and have won no grand slam titles. To visualise this shift, below is a graph of the average number of aces that each tournament winner had throughout that tournament, prior to the final.

The data definitely backs up the fact that having a big serve is becoming less important when it comes to winning big tournaments.

### heading
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:



{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
